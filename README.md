## Intro
The lowercase i is intentional, thou (you) may interpret it however thou wishes. Dates will be formatted as DD-MM-YY. i as a man will document all of the knowledge that i am permitted to write. i will write about in my own words on the books that i have read, the experiences that i have experienced, the dreams that i have dreamt, my current ideas of how the world works, and experimental ideas. i want to write about topics such as spirituality, philosophy, law, economics, computer science, science, qi gong, fascia maneuvers, health, memory, drawing and other topics that have made an impact in my life. Another note is that i will use "thou" or "thee" in place of "you" and "thy" or "thine" for "your"; The reason being is to respect the readers as we are made in the image of our creator. The other reason "ewe" is also pronounced as "you" and here is what etymology defines ewe.

> ewe (n.)
Old English eowu "female sheep," fem. of eow "sheep," from Proto-Germanic *awi, genitive *awjoz (source also of Old Saxon ewi, Old Frisian ei, Middle Dutch ooge, Dutch ooi, Old High German ouwi "sheep," Gothic awe√æi "flock of sheep"), from PIE *owi- "sheep" (source also of Sanskrit avih, Greek ois, Latin ovis, Lithuanian avis "sheep," Old Church Slavonic ovica "ewe," Old Irish oi "sheep," Welsh ewig "hind").

One of the problems with the English language is that homonyms exist. Morning and mourning, you and ewe, hertz and hurts may have a negative vibe in them; euphonics is another subject how sounds and letters may have a built-in, natural meaning in them. Remember, words are like magic and they can be music to our ears, they can affect people on an emotional level; this is not a little buttercup way of thinking, thy words have a big impact to the people around thee and even more when they know thee on a personal level. Every man and woman has their own hardships, there does not need to be another layer of dissonance in their lives. Anyway, whether one believes in a creator or not is personal but we need to inquire and find the truth. Life is about removing false beliefs and to experience the spectrum of experiences; to innerstand what it means to be a man or woman.

## Jack-of-all-trades
The importance of being a jack-of-all-trades is relating one subject to another subject as everything in life has a relationship to each other. Everything came from the same source, so to only know one subject is to stay in one room and to not explore the other rooms in the house. One may specialize in certain topics once a good foundation has been established to explore the earth with multiple lenses. i may include my artwork as well, i am here to tell a story in my own journey; what one may do after that is their decision as every man and woman is different from each other.

## How will this benefit me and thee?
As a man who thinks with phantasia which uses visualizations to innerstand/encode information rather than words, i need to improve my weakness through the subject of rhetoric which implements literary devices. In that way, i can share information in the best manner possible. There are many mediums to share information: music, art, writing, memes, and etc. therefore i will not limit myself to just writing. The benefit that thou will obtain reading through this repository is to see how i as a man evolves throughout this life moreover the summaries and reviews on others' works, and if thou likes my work, star this repository.

## Conclusion
At the end of the day, i am only promoting for others to inquire, to have curiosity into these subjects and to gain another perspective. i will do my upmost to prevent logical fallacies or any fallacy to occur but every living being on earth makes mistakes. If any material has been taken down, i shall have a back-up, local, external drive and will then re-upload it on another repository site. Thanks for reading and enjoy!
