i was in the living room, i somehow provoked a dog to bite another dog and did not have much thought of it; later i had remorse about it. In anothe scene, i was playing some type of VR video game where i could fly, shoot, and battle enemies with a team of allies. i was present in the ally base; the only allies i saw were female and my body would phase through them. Later, we went down a slope to fight enemies, i went ahead of the group and committed to a flank to direct enemy fire towards me. i was essentially aggroing their attention towards me. In another scene i was making another man make a decision on my behalf to choose from which baseball player was the best athlete. He chose one with a very strong sounding name.


Questions:

What does a dog signify and why was i was the cause of the violence?

Why were my allies female? Does it have to do with ying and yang?

Why was i doing a strategetic maneuver where it seems i was committing self sacrifice by aggroing the enemies' attention towards me?

Why did i allow another man decide on my behalf on a sport's athlete even though i do not know much about sports such as football, soccer, and baseball.
