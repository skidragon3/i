My mom and i drove to a store; she turned left two times. When we were in the store, there were those EMF bags.

i was at a dinner table, my mom on the left and my dad on the right. There was food in a clear, plastic lid container. i asked my dad about how it was cooked. Later my mom with super speed was saving important people in society from the green gang and she almost forgot about one member. i watched this through the window.
