There was a rude boy who entered the same public room as me. He was wearing an armless animal costume going towards me. Afterwards he did not have his costume on but he was rude to everyone around him that interacted with him. In the next scene, i was outside and there were a group of cancer kids, i brushed it off as i was going towards the outdoor dining table with people in their seats. i was seated at one end of the table not eating since my excuse was that i ate beforehand and i was there only to set a good example then relax in nature.
