i was entering a military base with my passport card that i have to swipe in order to enter. it took a few tries to get it right as i didn't know how to use the machine. later, i was lying on the ground next to a tree, afterwards i rose up and went towards where there was a karaoke machine with 2 people i used to know. i was singing some type of popular, rock song under a linen blanket then i tried to mimic the singer's voice.

The next scene, i was taking the elevators with a few other people, for some reason, one of the elevators were malfunctioning so we re-opened the doors and went to another 2 elevators in 2 seperate groups. This time the elevator work that i was in with another guy. i then was considered a dad.

i dreamt that there were two characters who has superpowers. they were flying in the sky and one of jealous of the other since she could not fly as fast as the other girl. later she stalked her and they both landed somewhere.
