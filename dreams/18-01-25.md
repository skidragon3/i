i was doing a mission where i had to destroy an escort vehicle, i had the power of Sonic's spinning roll and was able to shoot video game like pellets. Since i was doing the mission solo, i was not able to complete it since there were 2 guards protecting the escort vehicle.

i somehow got transported into a gym. i saw a few people in the gym: a female employee, and 3 other people (one guy, one female, cannot remember the other one). They were doing some type of gym challenge. On the side of the gym, i was doing handstands, i did 1 and a half laps then i was tired out. A past school friend checked up on me after finishing my exercise. i then went towards the restroom and bumped into a black, tall man who was supposedly my friend.

i was in a train fighting multiple opponents for some reason.

i was protecting animal eggs and trying to make them hatch while protecting them against predators like the eagle. i thought for some reason if i can make them hatch the eagles were not going to attack the babies anymore but that was not the case.
