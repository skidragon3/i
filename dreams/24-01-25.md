Trained Children assassins with nunchucks tried to kill the Flash. i was in a grocery store picking up a strawberry drink and then talked with a filipino about kefir being sour milk. i was later driving a van on a sidewalk almost crashing into a white subaru. Later, i was going on base and was not permitted by the guard to pass through since one of our IDs is invalid. i had 6 out of 7 IDs and mine was missing from the group. The base was having a lot of problems with spies and such.
