i sacrificed 4 starfox ships to summon a red dragon like being. i was shooting the dragon with rockets to destroy its layers and it has gotten thinner, the less layers appeared. i accidently shot Bulma, a DBZ character who was attached to the dragon. i then went and saved her from falling to the ground. i then looked into the night sky and saw a red curved line far away which i construed that it was the dragon but it is far away. i traveled from house to house to close the distance to the dragon but somehow got into a side-quest breaking into someone's home which turned out i had a Spanish speaking grandma though i don't have one in real life. Later i was in a game store where there were two gaming spots with computers. There was another scene where i was trying to place a shopping cart to not block any doors from opening.

Questions:
Why did i need to sacrifice 4 ships and what does the 4 symbolically signify?
Why was i attacking the creature that has a dragon-like form?
What does red symbolize in this instance?
Why did it become dark all of a sudden after rescuing Bulma?
i studied Spanish as a second language but not sure why i had a Spanish speaking grandma.
In the game store, there were two locations to play video games? What does 2 symbolize here?
Why was i trying to unblock the doors?
