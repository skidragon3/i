i was trying to kill ants in the backyard; first i used regular ant killer that one would find at a Home Depot in the back of a brown vehicle; later i used diatomaceous earth food grade to kill them afterwards.

i was playing a card game and was being double-teamed on. My hero card was Link and the other cards were sort of like pokemon. i used my hero cards specialty to pre-damage my opponent's monster to allow my monster to terminate it. i used 1 out of 50 arrows and attacked with my monster but did not finish off the enemy's monster. A childhood friend of mine was involved somehow.

i was at my old karate school performing katas with some blue belts. My old teacher was there as well.
