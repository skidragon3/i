The aboriginal tribes of Australia stored their information through oral means rather than stored in writings as the western orthodox of storing information. The aboriginal tribes used the terrain like memory palaces; music, art, and performances to encode the information, and the elders were the gatekeepers of the higher layers of knowledge. They stored all sorts of subjects and memorized a lot more than their "modern" counterparts. The stories that were passed down to the next generation allowed them to know the terrain without ever visiting the sites.
