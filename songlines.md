The aboriginal tribes of Australia stored their information through oral means rather than stored in writings in the form of books as its the western orthodox of storing information. The aboriginal tribes used the terrain which includes the sky, ocean, stars, land, reefs, islands, and any distinguishable land marks like memory palaces; music, art, and performances to encode the information, and the elders were the gatekeepers of the higher layers of knowledge as they do not want the information corrupted by others who are not ready to receive it. They stored all sorts of subjects in their body and memorized a lot more than their "modern" counterparts. The stories that were passed down to the next generation allowed them to know the terrain without ever visiting the sites. The descendants benefitted from their ancestors' adventures as the descendants may re-enact the history given to them.
