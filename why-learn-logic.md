# Why Learn Logic?

## Intro
Etymology:
> logic (n.)
mid-14c., logike, "branch of philosophy that treats of forms of thinking; the science of distinction of true from false reasoning," from Old French logique (13c.), from Latin (ars) logica "logic," from Greek (he) logike (techne) "(the) reasoning (art)," from fem. of logikos "pertaining to speaking or reasoning" (also "of or pertaining to speech"), from logos "reason, idea, word" (see Logos). Formerly also logick. Sometimes formerly plural, as in ethics, but this is not usual. Meaning "logical argumentation" is from c. 1600. Contemptuous logic-chopper "sophist, person who uses subtle distinctions in argument" is from 1846.
also from mid-14c.

> Logos (n.)
1580s, "the divine Word, second person of the Christian Trinity," from Greek logos "word, speech, statement, discourse," also "a computation, account," also "reason, judgment, understanding," from PIE *log-o-, suffixed form of root *leg- (1) "to collect, gather," with derivatives meaning "to speak," on notion of "to pick out words." The Greek word was used by Neo-Platonists in metaphysical and theological senses involving notions of both "reason" and "word" and subsequently picked up by New Testament writers.also from 1580s

> argue (v.)
c. 1300, "to make reasoned statements to prove or refute a proposition," from Old French arguer "maintain an opinion or view; harry, reproach, accuse, blame" (12c.), ultimately from Latin arguere "make clear, make known, prove, declare, demonstrate" (from  a suffixed form of PIE root *arg- "to shine; white"). The transmission to French might be via arguere in a Medieval Latin sense of "to argue," or from Latin argutare "to prattle, prate," frequentative of arguere. De Vaan says arguere is probably "a denominative verb 'to make bright, enlighten' to an adj. *argu- 'bright' as continued in argutus and outside Italic." He cites a closely similar formation in Hittite arkuuae- "to make a plea." The meaning "to oppose, dispute, contend in argument" is from late 14c. Related: Argued; arguing.

Logic allows one to ensure that the argument is valid and sound. It allows one to build their own arguments and to stay on guard when logical fallacies present themselves whether in one's own premises or the opponent using a logical fallacy against thee. There are many logical fallacies: red herring, lady in the red dress which steers the argument in a totally different direction; strawman where the argument becomes misconstrued, slippery slope fallacy where one event supposedly causes an inevitable outcome/event usually the subsequent event(s) are negative, false dilema where 2 choices are presented but there are actually more options which occurs in everyday life like grocery shopping where only 2 products are presented, equivocation where ambiguous language is used like in legalese, to overwrite a word's definition with another definiton, and much more.

i am starting to see that many people commit these fallacies everyday in modern science, politics, and other subjects. Cherry picking materials to support the stance for the argument to have a certain conclusion is plain wrong. For example, 9 out of 10 dentists recommend this toothpaste, if there are 1 million dentists but the product company only asks the opinion of 10 dentists that have a high probability of supporting their claims, what would be the result of that? They could have been dentists that could have had a monetary interest in recommending the product. We also need to stop picking articles from wikipedia, quora, or reddit and say its the Bible when its not. Also labeling people a certain term/name calling to discredit their stance keeps one from knowing the conclusion of the full argument. The fallacy fallacy is another issue as one's argument may be weak but it does not mean it is not true.
