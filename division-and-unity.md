# Division and Unity - i


## WIP

## Intro
Division and Unity is a very important topic to discuss. An artist uses individual colors to then unite on a canvas to create an image; a writer uses individual symbols to unite to create a coherent sentence which unites sentences to create paragraphs and etc.; a musician uses multiple, individual notes to combine them into a harmonious piece. In spirituality, to stay in one division of either heaven or earth will bring unbalance in one's conduct. To understand the division and unity i believe is important to have a balanced, whole life.

## Magic Symbols Example
i have professional experience as a web developer mostly developing front-end interfaces which developed a pragmatic way of thinking. i started to think of how to make complex things simple through the idea of layers and de-coupling. One can think of magical symbols that have a seperate responsibility. One symbol relates to conjuring fire and another relates to water. i can draw a fire magic symbol on one piece of paper and the water symbol on the other then i may combine them into one like a casserole. They are divided drawings that are then unified into one drawing. What happens when fire and water are mixed? The result is evaporation or steam. They harmonize to create another purpose rather than their original purpose seperately.

## Legos Example
Another way to think of the idea of division and unity is through lego pieces, each lego piece is divided from another until united with another lego piece. The result can be balanced or unbalanced depending on what lego pieces one chooses and the placement of each for the unified whole. One can create a magnificent piece, original piece, or a questionable one.

## Music Example
Music may have a harmonic rhythm and perfect combination of tones/notes that do not conflict with one another. When disharmonic tones are played at the same time, there is disharmony or division. One can distinguish combination of disharmonic tones than harmonic tones. The unbalanced rhythm and tones do not set right with us. This creates conflicts in our ears, soul, and etc. It does not resonate, we want to turn off the music.

## Definitions create Division and Relationships create Unity.

## Heaven and Earth
A purpose from the heavens is different from the purpose of the earth however when combined, creates the whole purpose.
