in the schools of the Middle Ages, "the first three liberal arts," by 1751, from Medieval Latin trivium (9c.)

Trivium is a book focusing on the first three liberal arts: grammar, logic, and rhetoric as denoted by the prefix tri meaning three. From classical Latin, trivium means place where three roads meet; where all men and women may gather to enjoy a great literary education. I think of the trivium as the triforce from Zelda, the video game. Link has courage to set things back into order, grammar; Zelda uses wisdom which may correlate to logic; and Ganon has moved society into darkness using his power of rhetoric. Easy way to think about it.

Grammar uses symbols which are combined into a more complex symbol, for example, the letters of the alphabet are individual symbols and when one combines those symbols to turn into words; those words then make a sentence and etc. The orthographic of a word relates to its spelling, and phoentics relates to the sound of a word hence the prefix sounds like phone which could be used as a mneumonic. Link goes and gathers items in treasure chests which is now in his arsenal. These items may be known as symbols that he sequentially procures from dungeon to dungeon. He uses all these tools at the end to fight Ganon and finishes the story.

Logic is important to ensure we logically create our arguments which derives from sound and valid premises; foundational, supporting statements to support the argument. Fallacies clutter the internet and it is hard to discern from what it is true and what is false. We may increase the probability to discern correctly through logic. People want to be right and while emotions allow one to stay in motion, it may play as a double edge sword creating an opposing force keeping the living being at a stand still which results in a plateau in one's faculties and evolution. Zelda needs to unveil the true intentions of a man or woman to decipher what is "good" and what is "evil".

Rhetoric uses the art of communication to move the audience. It uses the right communication method for the targeted audience. This distinguishes leaders from followers as leaders makes big impacts on society, though a follower may be a leader in their own right therefore not mutually exclusive. They can use incorrect grammar in a language or be 100% incorrect in their arguments but their mission is to essentially direct the audience to their intended destination. Ganon is the symbol of power and has put society into the dark ages in Ocarina of Time. He made things happen in his own image.
